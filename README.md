# Example React with Redux and @reduxjs/toolkit for global state mgmt

## Setup

Add deps

```bash
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @types/react-redux
```

We use react-redux (and associated types) for passing the redux store around, and @reduxjs/toolkit to create the stores, reducers, actions etc.

## Documentation

The code should be well-documented.
